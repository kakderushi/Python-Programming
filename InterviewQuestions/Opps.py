1. what is oops and how it implemented in python
ans: Object oriented programming is a programmingg paradigm that uses objects to reprsents real word
entities. in python , oops is implented through classes and objects classes are blueprints for creating objects and objects are instances of a class


2.what are four principles of oops
ans:
encapsulation:
bundling of data and methods that operate on that data within a single unit class
inheritance:
ability of a class to inherit properties and methods from its parent class
polymorphism:
ability of an object to take on differnt forms or behaviors based on the context
abstraction:
representing essential features and hiding unnecessary details to simplify complexity

3.What is method overloading in Python?
Method overloading in Python refers to defining
multiple methods with the same name but different
parameters within a class. However, Python does not
support method overloading by default as it does in
languages like Java. In Python, you can achieve a
similar effect by using default arguments or using
variable-length arguments.
4.What is method overriding in Python?
Method overriding in Python refers to defining a
method in a child class that already exists in its
parent class with the same name and signature. The
method in the child class overrides the method in the
parent class, providing a different implementation.

5. what is the differnce between a class method and instance method in python
ans:
a class method is a method bound to the class and not the instance of the class.
it is defined using the @classmethod decorator and can access only class level varibales
on the other hand, and instance method is bound to the instance of the class and can acceses both insttance and class level varibales
